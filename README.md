# negotiation-Chatbot
This project implements a negotiation chatbot using Google Generative AI (Gemini) for product price negotiation. It simulates a conversation between a chatbot (representing a seller) and a user (acting as the buyer). The chatbot offers dynamic responses based on the user's sentiment and logs API interactions for further analysis.
