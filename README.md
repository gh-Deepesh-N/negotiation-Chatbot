# negotiation-Chatbot
This project implements a negotiation chatbot using Google Generative AI (Gemini) for product price negotiation. It simulates a conversation between a chatbot (representing a seller) and a user (acting as the buyer). The chatbot offers dynamic responses based on the user's sentiment and logs API interactions for further analysis.

Key Components
Google Generative AI for Chat Responses:
The chatbot uses Google's Generative AI (google-generativeai SDK) to provide dynamic and context-aware responses to the user's input.
Sentiment Analysis:
The sentiment of the userâ€™s input is analyzed using TextBlob. Depending on whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral, the chatbot adapts its responses, offering better deals to polite users.
API Endpoint Logging:
Every API interaction is logged to track endpoints and facilitate debugging or analysis of API usage.
